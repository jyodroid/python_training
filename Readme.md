# Python learning

This repository is a compilation of python exercises in the road of learning

### Tech

* [Python] - version 2.7 and 3.5. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
* [Atom Editor] - A hackable text editor for the 21st Century
* [Fedora] - Linux redhat based operative system. version 25

And some Atom plugins

### Installation

Fedora already has python 2 and python 3 installed and you can se with the command

+ `ls /usr/bin/python*`

but we want to switch between version easily depending project so from the resulting list with the previous command we install alternatives with versions we will use

+ `sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.5 1`
+ `sudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 2`

to alternate between alternatives `sudo alternatives --config python` then select the number of the version you will use.

for development on ***atom editor***:

+ Install linter plug-in `apm install linter`
+ then install Python Linter package to show error on atom editor
  + install flake8  `pip install flake8`
  + install flake pep25 `pip install flake8-pep257`


+ Install linter for flake8 atom plug-in`apm install linter-flake8`
+ Install autocomplete for phyton `apm install autocomplete-python`
+ run examples with `python example_name.py`

### Create an executable from a python script

To create a standalone executable from a python script we use [Pyinstaller]

in the Pyinstaller downloaded folder we need to run:

```
python pyinstaller.py <route to script> --windowed -F
```

Pyinstaller will create an executable for the current SO. In Linux to create a Windows executable we can use ***wine*** with python installed and run

```
wine python pyinstaller.py <route to script> --windowed -F
```  

The executable will be generated on the ***script-name/dist*** folder of Pyinstaller downloaded folder
